# **Notes-App**
Taking notes app

## **Overview**
As part of Kalbonyan Almarsos program and The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp by Andrew Mead, I've built a simple notes app, 
a web app that can be used to create and save notes to help you never forget what to do.

[The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/) on Udemy.

## **Tools**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript / ES6

## **Features**
- Create new note with title and body.
- Edit your note.
- Filter your notes.
- Sort your notes.
- Remove a note.
- Know when last time you add or edit a note.
- Auto store your notes after done (Local Storage).

To get the application up and running locally, run these commands:
```
npm i
npm run dev-server
```
